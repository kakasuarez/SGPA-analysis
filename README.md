# SGPA-analysis
## Get Started
- Since GitHub doesn't allow uploading files with size more than 25 mb, first [download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q6nU_XhFzK8HdcghuysK8_s0zN3lk4PY?usp=sharing) the PDF files from the IMS portal.
- Rename the files as `first sem.pdf`, `third sem.pdf`, `fifth sem.pdf`, `seventh sem.pdf`.
- Place the files in the same folder as `create_data.py`.
- Now run `create_data.py`. This should create csv files with the roll numbers and SGPA of students. ☢️ **Note that sometimes the roll number is missing for some reason. So far, I have encountered only 2 instances and those too only in the third sem file. For now, you will have to update them manually.**
- Now that the data has been created, it is time to analyse. Open the `analysis.ipynb` file and run the code blocks in it.
